Virtual Serial Communication Using Socat
Steps to Establish Virtual Serial Communication
Create Virtual Serial Ports
Run the following command to establish virtual serial communication using socat:
socat -d -d PTY,link=/dev/myserialdev,raw,echo=0 PTY,link=/dev/ttyS1,raw,echo=0

Use sudo if Required
If you encounter permission issues, run the command with sudo:
sudo socat -d -d PTY,link=/dev/myserialdev,raw,echo=0 PTY,link=/dev/ttyS1,raw,echo=0

Verify Available COM Ports
Check the available COM ports using:
dmesg | grep "tty"

Ensure /dev/ttyS1 is Not in Use
Confirm that /dev/ttyS1 is not being used by any other process. You can check this with:
lsof /dev/ttyS1

Check COM Port Availability (Virtual Machines)
If using a virtual machine, verify the availability of COM ports under:
Machine -> Settings -> Serial Ports.

Test the Transmission
Open a new terminal and run the following commands to check if the communication is set up correctly:

Send data:
echo "hello" > /dev/myserialdev

Receive data:
cat /dev/ttyS1

Using Minicom for Communication:
Minicom is a serial communication tool that can be used to test the virtual serial ports. Follow these steps:

Install Minicom
Install minicom if it is not already installed:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install minicom

Configure Minicom
Launch Minicom and configure it for each serial port:
sudo minicom -s

Navigate to Serial Port Setup.
Set the Serial Device to /dev/myserialdev for one instance and /dev/ttyS1 for another.
Configure baud rate, parity, and stop bits as required (e.g., 9600 8N1).

Save the configuration and exit.

Test Communication

Open two terminal windows and run minicom on both ends:

In one terminal:
minicom -D /dev/myserialdev

In the other terminal:
minicom -D /dev/ttyS1

Type messages in one terminal and verify that they appear in the other.

Exit Minicom
Exit minicom by pressing Ctrl+A, then X, and confirm.
